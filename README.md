# LawAreaClassifier
The goal of the project is the creation of a multi-class classifier using a BERT model. By using a sentence, details or facts as an input, this classifier predicts the legal area to which it belongs. The dataset used to train the model is rcds/swiss_law_area_predictions from Hugging Face.
